For inclusive classrooms, I started this `EDI` project. I ask my students to write their names in their language on a paper and explain the meaning to foster a sense of cultural pride and identity within the classroom. 

I aim to celebrate linguistic diversity and encourage students to share aspects of their cultural heritage with their peers, promoting mutual understanding and respect. It ultimately creates a more inclusive and enriching learning environment where all students feel valued and respected.

Examples are:

|     Name    | Pronunciation  (Voice Recording) |                                                                                                                             Meaning                                                                                                                             |                                             Course/Project                                            |
